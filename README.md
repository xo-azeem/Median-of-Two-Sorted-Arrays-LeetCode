# Median of Two Sorted Arrays

LeetCode Q # 4.

Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Example 1:

>Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]</br>
>Output: 2.00000</br>
>Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.

Example 2:

>Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]</br>
>Output: 2.50000</br>
>Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
